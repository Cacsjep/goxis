# About

Goxis is a library designed to facilitate the development of ACAP (Axis Camera Application Platform) applications for AXIS cameras.

This library includes user-friendly wrappers for most APIs provided by the [native SDK](https://axiscommunications.github.io/acap-documentation/docs/api/native-sdk-api.html).

## C-API Wrappers

Goxis organizes its functionality around several key areas of the native SDK, each encapsulated within its own package for ease of use:

[![GoDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/go%20pkg-documentation-purple)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg)

- [axevent](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axevent) - Event API for managing camera events.
- [axoverlay](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axoverlay) - Overlay API, including support for Cairo, for drawing over video feeds.
- [axparameter](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axparameter) - Parameter API for managing camera parameters.
- [axstorage](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axstorage) - Edge Storage API for accessing and managing on-camera storage.
- [axvdo](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axvdo) - Video Capture API for handling video streams.
- [axlarod](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axlarod) - Larod API
- [axlicense](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axlicense) - License Key API for managing application licenses.
- [axsyslog](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axsyslog) - Syslog for logging and diagnostics.

## Additional Packages

Beyond the core API wrappers, Goxis also provides several additional packages designed to speed up the development process and enhance application capabilities:

- [acapapp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/acapapp) - Offers a high-level abstraction for quick and efficient ACAP application development.
- [axmanifest](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/axmanifest) - Aids in loading and parsing manifest files, simplifying application configuration and setup.
- [dbus](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/dbus) - Provides helpers for interacting with the D-Bus interface, including retrieving VAPIX credentials.
- [vapix](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/vapix) - Facilitates the use of the VAPIX API for interacting with camera functionalities.
- [glib](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/pkg/glib) - Includes helpers for working with GLib, such as managing the main event loop.

# Prerequisites
- Docker for building the ACAP applications
- [goxisbuilder](https://github.com/Cacsjep/goxisbuilder)

## Quickstart
```
go install github.com/Cacsjep/goxisbuilder@latest
goxisbuilder.exe -newapp
```

## Module Installation
```
go get github.com/Cacsjep/goxis
```

### Whats the purpose of goxis AcapApplication?
The `AcapApplication` acts as a foundational abstraction layer designed to streamline the handling of common tasks such as syslog logging, managing the GObject main loop, and the manipulation of parameters and events.

Upon instantiation, `AcapApplication` undertakes several crucial steps::
- **Manifest Parsing:** It reads the manifest file to extract the application's name.
- **Parameter Management:** Initializes an `axparameter` instance, enabling the application to get, set, and remove parameters efficiently.
- **Event Handling:** Sets up an `axevent` handler to facilitate event processing.
- **GMain Loop Preparation:** Configures a GMain loop complete with signal handlers, ensuring robust event management.

`AcapApplication` offers access to a variety of powerful functionalities, such as::
- **FrameProvider:** Facilitates easy interaction with `axvdo`, streamlining video-related operations.
- **OverlayProvide:** Facilitates easy interaction with `axoverlay` related operations.
- **StorageProvider:** Offers straightforward access to the camera's storage, enhancing data management capabilities.
- `app.IsLicenseValid(major_version int, minor_version int)`: Verifies the validity of the application's license for the specified version.
- `app.Run()`: Activates the GMain loop within the application, allowing for continuous operation.
- `app.GetSnapshot(video_channel int)`: Captures and retrieves a JPEG snapshot from a given video channel.

and more ....

### Create a new goxis application

Just use [goxisbuilder](https://github.com/Cacsjep/goxisbuilder) tool for streamlined builds.

```
.\goxisbuilder.exe -newapp
```

### ACAP Native SDK hardware compatibility

**Last Modified: 08.03.2024**

| Chip          | Architecture |
|---------------|--------------|
| ARTPEC-6      | armv7hf      |
| ARTPEC-7      | armv7hf      |
| ARTPEC-8      | aarch64      |

| S5L           | aarch64      |

### Manifest schema version mapping

**Mapping table for schema, firmware and SDK version.**

Itâ€™s recommended to use the latest manifest version available for the minimum firmware version targeted.

| Schema | Firmware | SDK  | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| 1.0    | 10.7     | 1.0  | Initial basic version |
| 1.1    | 10.7     | 1.0  | Additional fields, mainly for technical reasons |
| 1.2    | 10.7     | 1.0  | Enables uninstall functionality which is required by e.g. docker-compose-acap |
| 1.3    | 10.9     | 1.1  | Architecture will be automatically generated and added to manifest at packaging step |
| 1.3.1  | 11.0     | 1.4  | Bugfixes; Allow = in runOptions and maxLength of appName should be 26 |
| 1.4.0  | 11.7     | 1.11 | Allow new characters ( ) , . ! ? & ' for vendor field |
| 1.5.0  | 11.8     | 1.12 | - Add support for reverse proxy configuration.<br>- Add access policy for ACAP application web content.<br>- Allow - character in secondary groups of linux resources.<br>- Allow strings in requiredMethods and conditionalMethods under dbus to end with .* to match all methods of a D-Bus interface. |
| 1.6.0  | 11.9     | 1.13 | - Add support for characters $ and \ in apiPath of the reverse proxy configuration.<br>- Add optional field $schema that can point out a manifest schema to use for manifest validation and auto-completion.<br>- Allow strings in requiredMethods and conditionalMethods under dbus to contain -. |

### SDK for software compatibility

**Choose the appropriate SDK version based on what firmware version you want supporting your ACAP application.**
