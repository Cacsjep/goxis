# Goxis - The Golang AXIS Camera Framework
Goxis provides golang bindings for AXIS ACAP,
and some other helpers for interact with AXIS Cameras.

This is a hobby project and is still in progress !

The acap package of goxis is the low level wrappers around ACAP.
Goxis main package contains more high level interface to create ACAP Applications.

## Install
Goxis provides also its own docker build command to easy build apps for aarch64 and armv7hf.
```
go get github.com/Cacsjep/goxis
```


## Goxisbuilder
Goxis provides also its own docker build command to easy build apps for aarch64 and armv7hf.
```
go install github.com/Cacsjep/goxis/cmd/goxisbuilder@latest
```

### Usage
```
goxisbuilder -h                            

Usage of C:\Users\c.acs\go\bin\goxisbuilder.exe:
  -appdir string
        ***Full path*** of application directroy to build from
  -arch string
        ACAP Architecture: aarch64 or armv7hf (default "aarch64")
  -build-examples
        Build Examples
  -install
        Install on camera

  -libav
        Compile libav for binding it with go-astiav
  -pwd string
        Root password for camera where eap is installed
  -ip string
        IP for camera where eap is installed
  -start
        Start after install
  -watch
        Watch the package log after build
```

## Examples
Just digg into examples to see how you can use goxis.
Currently we had:
  - axevent 	| Demonstrate how to subscribe to an Virutal Input state change
  - axoverlay	| Render rects via axolveray api
  - axparameter   | Demonstrate how to get an parameter and listen to changes
  - license 	| Show how to obtain the license state
  - vdostream 	| High level wrapper demonstration to get video frames (stream)
  - webserver     | Reverse proxy webserver with fiber

# Manifest schema version mapping

**Mapping table for schema, firmware and SDK version.**

Itâ€™s recommended to use the latest manifest version available for the minimum firmware version targeted.

| Schema | Firmware | SDK  | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| 1.0    | 10.7     | 1.0  | Initial basic version |
| 1.1    | 10.7     | 1.0  | Additional fields, mainly for technical reasons |
| 1.2    | 10.7     | 1.0  | Enables uninstall functionality which is required by e.g. docker-compose-acap |
| 1.3    | 10.9     | 1.1  | Architecture will be automatically generated and added to manifest at packaging step |
| 1.3.1  | 11.0     | 1.4  | Bugfixes; Allow = in runOptions and maxLength of appName should be 26 |
| 1.4.0  | 11.7     | 1.11 | Allow new characters ( ) , . ! ? & ' for vendor field |
| 1.5.0  | 11.8     | 1.12 | - Add support for reverse proxy configuration.<br>- Add access policy for ACAP application web content.<br>- Allow - character in secondary groups of linux resources.<br>- Allow strings in requiredMethods and conditionalMethods under dbus to end with .* to match all methods of a D-Bus interface. |
| 1.6.0  | 11.9     | 1.13 | - Add support for characters $ and \ in apiPath of the reverse proxy configuration.<br>- Add optional field $schema that can point out a manifest schema to use for manifest validation and auto-completion.<br>- Allow strings in requiredMethods and conditionalMethods under dbus to contain -. |

# SDK for software compatibility

**Choose the appropriate SDK version based on what firmware version you want supporting your ACAP application.**

| SDK version | Compatible with firmware version |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| SDK 3.0     | 9.70 and later                   |
| SDK 3.1     | 9.80 (LTS) and later             |
| SDK 3.2     | 10.2 and later                   |
| SDK 3.3     | 10.5 and later                   |
| SDK 3.4     | 10.6 and later                   |
| SDK 3.5     | 10.9 and later                   |
